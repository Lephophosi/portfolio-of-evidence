This code uses Difference in differences (DiD) statistical technique to estimating the causal effect of interventions by comparing the changes in outcomes over time between a treatment group (AASA supported schools) and a control group (non supported random schools).
Code compares the previous year NSC results with the current year NSC result in this case (2023 and 2014) and checks whether for each supported AASA school there has been improvement the same analysis is performed on the control group
Colour codes schools according to the different quantiles and improvement results.
Outputs the report that is used to select a package of interventions that can be employed to mitagate pitfalls that are revealed by the output report as this technique estimate shows how much more the treated group changed than the control group - attributing that extra change to the intervention.
