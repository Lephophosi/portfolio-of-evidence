This script consolidates data from multiple implementation reporting sources (submitted by IPs across various platforms) into a single, unified dataset. It then performs structured data cleaning and validation which includes:

Verifying completeness of key participant identifiers
(e.g., name, unique ID, SACE number)
Checking school alignment to ensure entries only reflect AASA-supported schools
Identifying and flagging duplicate records for review
Validating critical programme fields such as:
Date of support
School name
Grade and subject
Duration of support session
Focus of support
Visit outcomes / session results

These steps ensure that only accurate, relevant, and well-structured data is used for analysis and reporting, thereby strengthening the integrity of programme performance insights
